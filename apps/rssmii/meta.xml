    <short_description>Subscribe to RSS feeds!</short_description>
    <long_description>With RSSMii you can subscribe to RSS feeds right on your Wii! And you will receive updates as messages at the Wii message board!
The momebrew reads a feeds.xml from the root of your SD card and subscribes to all the feeds listed there while all previous subscriptions will be removed.
So you can actually just update the feeds.xml if you want to change your subscriptions and rssmii will write the changes to the NAND of your Wii!

This is a modification by WiiDatabase.de.</long_description>
